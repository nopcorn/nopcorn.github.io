In a recent red team engagement, I encountered an curious scenario while navigating a Kubernetes cluster. After exploiting a vulnerability in an ephemeral pod and deploying a customized version of the [Poseidon](https://github.com/MythicAgents/poseidon) agent, I turned to lateral movement and privilege escalation. Generally, I start with the stored API creds already available in the pod located in `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token` to see what I can access.

In this case - I couldn't access anything. This effectively rendered the Kubernetes API useless for further exploration unless I found a new token to try out. I turned to classic old-school lateral movement and host dicovery.

I knew a SentinelOne agent was present on the hypervisor so fast network-based host discovery via `nmap` or `zmap` would be much too noisy and risk giving away the attacker advantage so early in the engagement. I thought about writing a quick and dirty python scanner with generous sleeping in between hosts, but after discovering I was in a `/16` I didn't have the patience to sit through slowly working by way through 65000 potential live IPs. Additionally, I could identify a live IP but due to how Kubernetes clusters are managed that IP could be reassigned or abandoned at any time if a new deployment or load balancing was performed.

Instead I looked for quieter ways of identifying services and pods that wouldn't be as scritized by security products and audit logs, but allowed me to progress somewhat quickly. I decided to take a look at how CoreDNS worked as there was likely less visibility on DNS queries and reoslutions within a cluster. 

In Kubernetes, DNS is used by pods to identify other services available in the cluster as IPs change frequently. Every service in Kubernetes is provisioned an entry in the cluster's DNS that corresponds to its service name and the namespace that it's in:

![](/assets/img/k8s-dns-structure.png)

The only namespace I knew of was the one I was currently in (found in `/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/namespace`). I debated generating a wordlist of common namespace and service names but decided against bruteforcing. 

From previously listing network interfaces, I knew that I was in a `/16` network and could iterate through the IP addresses performing [reverse lookups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_DNS_lookup) if CoreDNS automatically inserted PRT records or if it resolved the `in-addr.arpa` domain name.

As it so happens, this is a [feature of CoreDNS which is enabled by default](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-custom-nameservers/#coredns). The `in-addr.arpa` domain being present allows for the server to automatically resolve our reverse lookups.

I wrote a quick and dirty pastable python script that will read an IP range in CIDR notation from the environment and try a reverse resolution for each IP:

```python
import socket
import ipaddress
import os

cidr = os.environ.get('cidr')
net = ipaddress.ip_network(cidr)
for ip in net:
    name = socket.getnameinfo((str(ip), 0), 0)[0]
    try:
        ipaddress.ip_address(name)
    except ValueError:
        print(f'{name} -> {ip}') 
```

Collapsing this script into a one liner and running it through python looks something like this:

```shell
$ cidr="172.20.0.0/16" python3 -c "exec(\"import socket\nimport ipaddress\nimport os\n\ncidr = os.environ.get('cidr')\nnet = ipaddress.ip_network(cidr)\n\nfor ip in net:\n\tname = socket.getnameinfo((str(ip), 0), 0)[0]\n\ttry:\n\t\tipaddress.ip_address(name)\n\texcept ValueError:\n\t\tprint(f'{name} -> {ip}')\")" | grep -v "compute"
```

I had to grep out the non-service responses or else every IP address would return a default AWS resolution like `ip-172-20-0-7.us-east-1.compute.internal`.


Letting this script run for a bit gave me a complete list of services in the cluster and their currently associated IP addresses. Additionally, because the namespace a service is hosted in appears in the domain name for it, I get a partial list of valid namespaces in the cluster. __This essentially allows an unprivileged token to give itself the `list` verb on the `services` and `namespaces` resources, even if they have been explicitly denied__.

Armed with a list of valid services in the network I could now pivot to software identification and port scanning.
